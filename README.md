# ChatServer
An easy to use python scripts providing you the ability to chat with others throught a socket server, the server has no limit users and comes with some simple commands.
# Usage
First, You'll need to install tkinter, that can be done with the command below:

``` pip install tk ```

After that you'll be able to run the scripts.

for windows:
```python client.py```

for linux:
```python3 client.py```
Finally, the script will ask you for the host ip, port and username (note: the ip and port should be the same as the server's and the username shouldnt be used by another user)

# Server setup
You'll need to edit the script, changing the ip address and the port to the ones you have. This operation can get a little complicated so make sure you watch some tutorials on how to host a public server on your local machine.
